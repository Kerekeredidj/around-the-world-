     <h2>Info about H.l.</h2>

<p>The H.l. (Human launcher) was an idea made when the develper of the H.l. "Mohab Mohamed" was in his car in a trafic jam and he wanted to pass it he thought motorcycles are dangerous so he got the idea of the H.L.(Human launcher) witch is a human launcher that uses G.P.S.H Global Positioning System Hyper which is an upgrade of the past years G.P.S. (Global Positioning System) it's first prototype was made in 1/1/2020 it used G.P.S. (Global Positioning System) the resaults showed That it was't acurate so it got upgraded in the date 24/6/2020 to the G.P.S.H (Globale Positioning System Hyper) it's safty features were a few in the prototype that are called : "Cancele" launch (the canon won't launch until you pull the lever) "Safety pillows" (a pillows are on your body so you wont be harmed) "Air check" (A robot will be watching you and if you dont have something to protect you from fall damage it will put a pillow so it saves you) But now it has more like : "Location check" (yout location will be sent to people that you pick) and some upgraded ones like : "Air check"(The robot is now much faster)  </p>
